      "Explanation": "A key consideration for resource organization design is to simplify management across the environment for increased workload numbers and scale.  Dedicated subscriptions are recommended for the different platform resource categories to ensure scale, sustainability, and segregation of duties.  A single subscription can be used for proof of concepts, or by smaller organizations. \n\nIt is recommended separate platform subscriptions for management (monitoring), connectivity, and identity when they're required. \n\nEstablish a dedicated management subscription in your platform management group to support global management capabilities like Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspaces and Azure Automation runbooks. \nEstablish a dedicated identity subscription in your platform management group to host Windows Server Active Directory domain controllers when needed. \nEstablish a dedicated connectivity subscription in your platform management group to host an Azure Virtual WAN hub, private Domain Name System (DNS), ExpressRoute circuit, and other networking resources.  A dedicated subscription ensures that all your foundation network resources are billed together and isolated from other workloads. \nUse subscriptions as a democratized unit of management aligned with your business needs and priorities.",
